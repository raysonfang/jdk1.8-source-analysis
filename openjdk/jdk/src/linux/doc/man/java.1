.SH NAME    
java \- Launches a Java application\&.
.SH SYNOPSIS    
.sp     
.nf     

\fBjava\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fIclassname\fR [\fIargs\fR]
.fi     
.nf     

\fBjava\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fB\-jar\fR \fIfilename\fR [\fIargs\fR]
.fi     
.sp     
.TP     
\fIoptions\fR
Command-line options separated by spaces\&. See Options\&.
.TP     
\fIclassname\fR
The name of the class to be launched\&.
.TP     
\fIfilename\fR
The name of the Java Archive (JAR) file to be called\&. Used only with the \f3-jar\fR option\&.
.TP     
\fIargs\fR
The arguments passed to the \f3main()\fR method separated by spaces\&.
.SH DESCRIPTION    
The \f3java\fR command starts a Java application\&. It does this by starting the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), loading the specified class, and calling that class\&'s \f3main()\fR method\&. The method must be declared \fIpublic\fR and \fIstatic\fR, it must not return any value, and it must accept a \f3String\fR array as a parameter\&. The method declaration has the following form:
.sp     
.nf     
\f3public static void main(String[] args)\fP
.fi     
.nf     
\f3\fP
.fi     
.sp     
The \f3java\fR command can be used to launch a JavaFX application by loading a class that either has a \f3main()\fR method or that extends \f3javafx\&.application\&.Application\fR\&. In the latter case, the launcher constructs an instance of the \f3Application\fR class, calls its \f3init()\fR method, and then calls the \f3start(javafx\&.stage\&.Stage)\fR method\&.
.PP
By default, the first argument that is not an option of the \f3java\fR command is the fully qualified name of the class to be called\&. If the \f3-jar\fR option is specified, its argument is the name of the JAR file containing class and resource files for the application\&. The startup class must be indicated by the \f3Main-Class\fR manifest header in its source code\&.
.PP
The JRE searches for the startup class (and other classes used by the application) in three sets of locations: the bootstrap class path, the installed extensions, and the user\(cqs class path\&.
.PP
Arguments after the class file name or the JAR file name are passed to the \f3main()\fR method\&.
.SH OPTIONS    
The \f3java\fR command supports a wide range of options that can be divided into the following categories:
.TP 0.2i    
\(bu
Standard Options
.TP 0.2i    
\(bu
Non-Standard Options
.TP 0.2i    
\(bu
Advanced Runtime Options
.TP 0.2i    
\(bu
Advanced JIT Compiler Options
.TP 0.2i    
\(bu
Advanced Serviceability Options
.TP 0.2i    
\(bu
Advanced Garbage Collection Options
.PP
Standard options are guaranteed to be supported by all implementations of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)\&. They are used for common actions, such as checking the version of the JRE, setting the class path, enabling verbose output, and so on\&.
.PP
Non-standard options are general purpose options that are specific to the Java HotSpot Virtual Machine, so they are not guaranteed to be supported by all JVM implementations, and are subject to change\&. These options start with \f3-X\fR\&.
.PP
Advanced options are not recommended for casual use\&. These are developer options used for tuning specific areas of the Java HotSpot Virtual Machine operation that often have specific system requirements and may require privileged access to system configuration parameters\&. They are also not guaranteed to be supported by all JVM implementations, and are subject to change\&. Advanced options start with \f3-XX\fR\&.
.PP
To keep track of the options that were deprecated or removed in the latest release, there is a section named Deprecated and Removed Options at the end of the document\&.
.PP
Boolean options are used to either enable a feature that is disabled by default or disable a feature that is enabled by default\&. Such options do not require a parameter\&. Boolean \f3-XX\fR options are enabled using the plus sign (\f3-XX:+\fR\fIOptionName\fR) and disabled using the minus sign (\f3-XX:-\fR\fIOptionName\fR)\&.
.PP
For options that require an argument, the argument may be separated from the option name by a space, a colon (:), or an equal sign (=), or the argument may directly follow the option (the exact syntax differs for each option)\&. If you are expected to specify the size in bytes, you can use no suffix, or use the suffix \f3k\fR or \f3K\fR for kilobytes (KB), \f3m\fR or \f3M\fR for megabytes (MB), \f3g\fR or \f3G\fR for gigabytes (GB)\&. For example, to set the size to 8 GB, you can specify either \f38g\fR, \f38192m\fR, \f38388608k\fR, or \f38589934592\fR as the argument\&. If you are expected to specify the percentage, use a number from 0 to 1 (for example, specify \f30\&.25\fR for 25%)\&.
.SS STANDARD\ OPTIONS    
These are the most commonly used options that are supported by all implementations of the JVM\&.
.TP
-agentlib:\fIlibname\fR[=\fIoptions\fR]
.br
Loads the specified native agent library\&. After the library name, a comma-separated list of options specific to the library can be used\&.

If the option \f3-agentlib:foo\fR is specified, then the JVM attempts to load the library named \f3libfoo\&.so\fR in the location specified by the \f3LD_LIBRARY_PATH\fR system variable (on OS X this variable is \f3DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH\fR)\&.

The following example shows how to load the heap profiling tool (HPROF) library and get sample CPU information every 20 ms, with a stack depth of 3:
.sp     
.nf     
\f3\-agentlib:hprof=cpu=samples,interval=20,depth=3\fP
.fi     
.nf     
\f3\fP
.fi     
.sp     


The following example shows how to load the Java Debug Wire Protocol (JDWP) library and listen for the socket connection on port 8000, suspending the JVM before the main class loads:
.sp     
.nf     
\f3\-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,address=8000\fP
.fi     
.nf     
\f3\fP
.fi     
.sp

.RE     

.TP
-agentpath:\fIpathname\fR[=\fIoptions\fR]
.br
Loads the native agent library specified by the absolute path name\&. This option is equivalent to \f3-agentlib\fR but uses the full path and file name of the library\&.
.TP
-client
.br
Selects the Java HotSpot Client VM\&. The 64-bit version of the Java SE Development Kit (JDK) currently ignores this option and instead uses the Server JVM\&.

For default JVM selection, see Server-Class Machine Detection at http://docs\&.oracle\&.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/vm/server-class\&.html
.TP
-D\fIproperty\fR=\fIvalue\fR
.br
Sets a system property value\&. The \fIproperty\fR variable is a string with no spaces that represents the name of the property\&. The \fIvalue\fR variable is a string that represents the value of the property\&. If \fIvalue\fR is a string with spaces, then enclose it in quotation marks (for example \f3-Dfoo="foo bar"\fR)\&.
.TP
-d32
.br
Runs the application in a 32-bit environment\&. If a 32-bit environment is not installed or is not supported, then an error will be reported\&. By default, the application is run in a 32-bit environment unless a 64-bit system is used\&.
.TP
-d64
.br
Runs the application in a 64-bit environment\&. If a 64-bit environment is not installed or is not supported, then an error will be reported\&. By default, the application is run in a 32-bit environment unless a 64-bit system is used\&.

Currently only the Java HotSpot Server VM supports 64-bit operation, and the \f3-server\fR option is implicit with the use of \f3-d64\fR\&. The \f3-client\fR option is ignored with the use of \f3-d64\fR\&. This is subject to change in a future release\&.
.TP
.nf
-disableassertions[:[\fIpackagename\fR]\&.\&.\&.|:\fIclassname\fR], -da[:[\fIpackagename\fR]\&.\&.\&.|:\fIclassname\fR]
.br
.fi
Disables assertions\&. By default, assertions are disabled in all packages and classes\&.

With no arguments, \f3-disableassertions\fR (\f3-da\fR) disables assertions in all packages and classes\&. With the \fIpackagename\fR argument ending in \f3\&.\&.\&.\fR, the switch disables assertions in the specified package and any subpackages\&. If the argument is simply \f3\&.\&.\&.\fR, then the switch disables assertions in the unnamed package in the current working directory\&. With the \fIclassname\fR argument\f3\fR, the switch disables assertions in the specified class\&.

The \f3-disableassertions\fR (\f3-da\fR) option applies to all class loaders and to system classes (which do not have a class loader)\&. There is one exception to this rule: if the option is provided with no arguments, then it does not apply to system classes\&. This makes it easy to disable assertions in all classes except for system classes\&. The \f3-disablesystemassertions\fR option enables you to disable assertions in all system classes\&.

To explicitly enable assertions in specific packages or classes, use the \f3-enableassertions\fR (\f3-ea\fR) option\&. Both options can be used at the same time\&. For example, to run the \f3MyClass\fR application with assertions enabled in package \f3com\&.wombat\&.fruitbat\fR (and any subpackages) but disabled in class \f3com\&.wombat\&.fruitbat\&.Brickbat\fR, use the following command:
.sp     
.nf     
\f3java \-ea:com\&.wombat\&.fruitbat\&.\&.\&. \-da:com\&.wombat\&.fruitbat\&.Brickbat MyClass\fP
.fi     
.nf     
\f3\fP
.fi     
.sp     

.TP
-disablesystemassertions, -dsa
.br
Disables assertions in all system classes\&.
.TP
.nf
-enableassertions[:[\fIpackagename\fR]\&.\&.\&.|:\fIclassname\fR], -ea[:[\fIpackagename\fR]\&.\&.\&.|:\fIclassname\fR]
.br
.fi
Enables assertions\&. By default, assertions are disabled in all packages and classes\&.

With no arguments, \f3-enableassertions\fR (\f3-ea\fR) enables assertions in all packages and classes\&. With the \fIpackagename\fR argument ending in \f3\&.\&.\&.\fR, the switch enables assertions in the specified package and any subpackages\&. If the argument is simply \f3\&.\&.\&.\fR, then the switch enables assertions in the unnamed package in the current working directory\&. With the \fIclassname\fR argument\f3\fR, the switch enables assertions in the specified class\&.

The \f3-enableassertions\fR (\f3-ea\fR) option applies to all class loaders and to system classes (which do not have a class loader)\&. There is one exception to this rule: if the option is provided with no arguments, then it does not apply to system classes\&. This makes it easy to enable assertions in all classes except for system classes\&. The \f3-enablesystemassertions\fR option provides a separate switch to enable assertions in all system classes\&.

To explicitly disable assertions in specific packages or classes, use the \f3-disableassertions\fR (\f3-da\fR) option\&. If a single command contains multiple instances of these switches, then they are processed in order before loading any classes\&. For example, to run the \f3MyClass\fR application with assertions enabled only in package \f3com\&.wombat\&.fruitbat\fR (and any subpackages) but disabled in class \f3com\&.wombat\&.fruitbat\&.Brickbat\fR, use the following command:
.sp     
.nf     
\f3java \-ea:com\&.wombat\&.fruitbat\&.\&.\&. \-da:com\&.wombat\&.fruitbat\&.Brickbat MyClass\fP
.fi     
.nf     
\f3\fP
.fi     
.sp     

.TP
-enablesystemassertions, -esa
.br
Enables assertions in all system classes\&.
.TP
-help, -?
.br
Displays usage information for the \f3java\fR command without actually running the JVM\&.
.TP
-jar \fIfilename\fR
.br
Executes a program encapsulated in a JAR file\&. The \fIfilename\fR argument is the name of a JAR file with a manifest that contains a line in the form \f3Main-Class:\fR\fIclassname\fR that defines the class with the \f3public static void main(String[] args)\fR method that serves as your application\&'s starting point\&.

When you use the \f3-jar\fR option, the specified JAR file is the source of all user classes, and other class path settings are ignored\&.

-javaagent:\fIjarpath\fR[=\fIoptions\fR]
.br
Loads the specified Java programming language agent\&. For more information about instrumenting Java applications, see the \f3java\&.lang\&.instrument\fR package description in the Java API documentation at http://docs\&.oracle\&.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/instrument/package-summary\&.html
.TP
-jre-restrict-search
.br
Includes user-private JREs in the version search\&.
.TP
-no-jre-restrict-search
.br
Excludes user-private JREs from the version search\&.
.TP
-server
.br
Selects the Java HotSpot Server VM\&. The 64-bit version of the JDK supports only the Server VM, so in that case the option is implicit\&.

For default JVM selection, see Server-Class Machine Detection at http://docs\&.oracle\&.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/vm/server-class\&.html
.TP
-showversion
.br
Displays version information and continues execution of the application\&. This option is equivalent to the \f3-version\fR option except that the latter instructs the JVM to exit after displaying version information\&.
.TP
-splash:\fIimgname\fR
.br
Shows the splash screen with the image specified by \fIimgname\fR\&. For example, to show the \f3splash\&.gif\fR file from the \f3images\fR directory when starting your application, use the following option:
.sp     
.nf     
\f3\-splash:images/splash\&.gif\fP
.fi     
.nf     
\f3\fP
.fi     
.sp     

.TP
-verbose:class
.br
Displays information about each loaded class\&.
.TP
-verbose:gc
.br
Displays information about each garbage collection (GC) event\&.
.TP
-verbose:jni
.br
Displays information about the use of native methods and other Java Native Interface (JNI) activity\&.
.TP
-version
.br
Displays version information and then exits\&. This option is equivalent to the \f3-showversion\fR option except that the latter does not instruct the JVM to exit after displaying version information\&.
.TP
-version:\fIrelease\fR
.br
Specifies the release version to be used for running the application\&. If the version of the \f3java\fR command called does not meet this specification and an appropriate implementation is found on the system, then the appropriate implementation will be used\&.

The \fIrelease\fR argument specifies either the exact version string, or a list of version strings and ranges separated by spaces\&. A \fIversion string\fR is the developer designation of the version number in the following form: \f31\&.\fR\fIx\fR\f3\&.0_\fR\fIu\fR (where \fIx\fR is the major version number, and \fIu\fR is the update version number)\&. A \fIversion range\fR is made up of a version string followed by a plus sign (\f3+\fR) to designate this version or later, or a part of a version string followed by an asterisk (\f3*\fR) to designate any version string with a matching prefix\&. Version strings and ranges can be combined using a space for a logical \fIOR\fR combination, or an ampersand (\f3&\fR) for a logical \fIAND\fR combination of two version strings/ranges\&. For example, if running the class or JAR file requires either JRE 6u13 (1\&.6\&.0_13), or any JRE 6 starting from 6u10 (1\&.6\&.0_10), specify the following:
.sp     
.nf     
\f3\-version:"1\&.6\&.0_13 1\&.6* & 1\&.6\&.0_10+"\fP
.fi     
.nf     
\f3\fP
.fi     
.sp     


Quotation marks are necessary only if there are spaces in the \fIrelease\fR parameter\&.

For JAR files, the preference is to specify version requirements in the JAR file manifest rather than on the command line\&.
.SS NON-STANDARD\ OPTIONS    
These options are general purpose options that are specific to the Java HotSpot Virtual Machine\&.
.TP
-X
.br
Displays help for all available \f3-X\fR options\&.
.TP
-Xbatch
.br
Disables background compilation\&. By default, the JVM compiles the method as a background task, running the method in interpreter mode until the background compilation is finished\&. The \f3-Xbatch\fR flag disables background compilation so that compilation of all methods proceeds as a foreground task until completed\&.

This option is equivalent to \f3-XX:-BackgroundCompilation\fR\&.
.TP
-Xbootclasspath:\fIpath\fR
.br
Specifies a list of directories, JAR files, and ZIP archives separated by colons (:) to search for boot class files\&. These are used in place of the boot class files included in the JDK\&.

\fI\fRDo not deploy applications that use this option to override a class in \f3rt\&.jar\fR, because this violates the JRE binary code license\&.
.TP
-Xbootclasspath/a:\fIpath\fR
.br
Specifies a list of directories, JAR files, and ZIP archives separated by colons (:) to append to the end of the default bootstrap class path\&.

Do not deploy applications that use this option to override a class in \f3rt\&.jar\fR, because this violates the JRE binary code license\&.
.TP
-Xbootclasspath/p:\fIpath\fR
.br
Specifies a list of directories, JAR files, and ZIP archives separated by colons (:) to prepend to the front of the default bootstrap class path\&.

Do not deploy applications that use this option to override a class in \f3rt\&.jar\fR, because this violates the JRE binary code license\&.
.TP
-Xboundthreads
.br
Binds user-level threads to kernel threads\&.
.TP
-Xcheck:jni
.br
Performs additional checks for Java Native Interface (JNI) functions\&. Specifically, it validates the parameters passed to the JNI function and the runtime environment data before processing the JNI request\&. Any invalid data encountered indicates a problem in the native code, and the JVM will terminate with an irrecoverable error in such cases\&. Expect a performance degradation when this option is used\&.
.TP
-Xcomp
.br
Forces compilation of methods on first invocation\&. By default, the Client VM (\f3-client\fR) performs 1,000 interpreted method invocations and the Server VM (\f3-server\fR) performs 10,000 interpreted method invocations to gather information for efficient compilation\&. Specifying the \f3-Xcomp\fR option disables interpreted method invocations to increase compilation performance at the expense of efficiency\&.

You can also change the number of interpreted method invocations before compilation using the \f3-XX:CompileThreshold\fR option\&.
.TP
-Xdebug
.br
Does nothing\&. Provided for backward compatibility\&.
.TP
-Xdiag
.br
Shows additional diagnostic messages\&.
.TP
-Xfuture
.br
Enables strict class-file format checks that enforce close conformance to the class-file format specification\&. Developers are encouraged to use this flag when developing new code because the stricter checks will become the default in future releases\&.
.TP
-Xint
.br
Runs the application in interpreted-only mode\&. Compilation to native code is disabled, and all bytecode is executed by the interpreter\&. The performance benefits offered by the just in time (JIT) compiler are not present in this mode\&.
.TP
-Xinternalversion
.br
Displays more detailed JVM version information than the \f3-version\fR option, and then exits\&.
.TP
-Xloggc:\fIfilename\fR
.br
Sets the file to which verbose GC events information should be redirected for logging\&. The information written to this file is similar to the output of \f3-verbose:gc\fR with the time elapsed since the first GC event preceding each logged event\&. The \f3-Xloggc\fR option overrides \f3-verbose:gc\fR if both are given with the same \f3java\fR command\&.

Example:
.sp     
.nf     
\f3\-Xloggc:garbage\-collection\&.log\fP
.fi     
.nf     
\f3\fP
.fi     
.sp     

.TP
-Xmaxjitcodesize=\fIsize\fR
.br
Specifies the maximum code cache size (in bytes) for JIT-compiled code\&. Append the letter \f3k\fR or \f3K\fR to indicate kilobytes, \f3m\fR or \f3M\fR to indicate megabytes, \f3g\fR or \f3G\fR to indicate gigabytes\&. By default, the value is set to 48 MB:
.sp     
.nf     
\f3\-Xmaxjitcodesize=48m\fP
.fi     
.nf     
\f3\fP
.fi     
.sp     


This option is equivalent to \f3-XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize\fR\&.
.TP
-Xmixed
.br
Executes all bytecode by the interpreter except for hot methods, which are compiled to native code\&.
.TP
-Xmn\fIsize\fR
.br
Sets the initial and maximum size (in bytes) of the heap for the young generation (nursery)\&. Append the letter \f3k\fR or \f3K\fR to indicate kilobytes, \f3m\fR or \f3M\fR to indicate megabytes, \f3g\fR or \f3G\fR to indicate gigabytes\&.

The young generation region of the heap is used for new objects\&. GC is performed in this region more often than in other regions\&. If the size for the young generation is too small, then a lot of minor garbage collections will be performed\&. If the size is too large, then only full garbage collections will be performed, which can take a long time to complete\&. Oracle recommends that you keep the size for the young generation between a half and a quarter of the overall heap size\&.

The following examples show how to set the initial and maximum size of young generation to 256 MB using various units:
.sp     
.nf     
\f3\-Xmn256m\fP
.fi     
.nf     
\f3\-Xmn262144k\fP
.fi     
.nf     
\f3\-Xmn268435456\fP
.fi     
.nf     
\f3\fP
.fi     
.sp     


Instead of the \f3-Xmn\fR option to set both the initial and maximum size of the heap for the young generation, you can use \f3-XX:NewSize\fR to set the initial size and \f3-XX:MaxNewSize\fR to set the maximum size\&.
.TP
-Xms\fIsize\fR
.br
Sets the initial size (in bytes) of the heap\&. This value must be a multiple of 1024 and greater than 1 MB\&. Append the letter \f3k\fR or \f3K\fR to indicate kilobytes, \f3m\fR or \f3M\fR to indicate megabytes, \f3g\fR or \f3G\fR to indicate gigabytes\&.

The following examples show how to set the size of allocated memory to 6 MB using various units:
.sp     
.nf     
\f3\-Xms6291456\fP
.fi     
.nf     
\f3\-Xms6144k\fP
.fi     
.nf     
\f3\-Xms6m\fP
.fi     
.nf     
\f3\fP
.fi     
.sp     


If you do not set this option, then the initial size will be set as the sum of the sizes allocated for the old generation and the young generation\&. The initial size of the heap for the young generation can be set using the \f3-Xmn\fR option or the \f3-XX:NewSize\fR option\&.
.TP
-Xmx\fIsize\fR
.br
Specifies the maximum size (in bytes) of the memory allocation pool in bytes\&. This value must be a multiple of 1024 and greater than 2 MB\&. Append the letter \f3k\fR or \f3K\fR to indicate kilobytes, \f3m\fR or \f3M\fR to indicate megabytes, \f3g\fR or \f3G\fR to indicate gigabytes\&. The default value is chosen at runtime based on system configuration\&. For server deployments, \f3-Xms\fR and \f3-Xmx\fR are often set to the same value\&. For more information, see Garbage Collector Ergonomics at http://docs\&.oracle\&.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/vm/gc-ergonomics\&.html

.TP
-Xrs
.br
Reduces the use of operating system signals by the JVM\&.

Shutdown hooks enable orderly shutdown of a Java application by running user cleanup code (such as closing database connections) at shutdown, even if the JVM terminates abruptly\&.

The JVM catches signals to implement shutdown hooks for unexpected termination\&. The JVM uses \f3SIGHUP\fR, \f3SIGINT\fR, and \f3SIGTERM\fR to initiate the running of shutdown hooks\&.

The JVM uses a similar mechanism to implement the feature of dumping thread stacks for debugging purposes\&. The JVM uses \f3SIGQUIT\fR to perform thread dumps\&.

Applications embedding the JVM frequently need to trap signals such as \f3SIGINT\fR or \f3SIGTERM\fR, which can lead to interference with the JVM signal handlers\&. The \f3-Xrs\fR option is available to address this issue\&. When \f3-Xrs\fR is used, the signal masks for \f3SIGINT\fR, \f3SIGTERM\fR, \f3SIGHUP\fR, and \f3SIGQUIT\fR are not changed by the JVM, and signal handlers for these signals are not installed\&.

There are two consequences of specifying \f3-Xrs\fR:

-XX:CompileCommand=\fIcommand\fR,\fImethod\fR[,\fIoption\fR]
.br
Specifies a command to perform on a method\&. For example, to exclude the \f3indexOf()\fR method of the \f3String\fR class from being compiled, use the following:
.sp     
.nf     
\f3\-XX:CompileCommand=exclude,java/lang/String\&.indexOf\fP
.fi     
.nf     
\f3\fP
.fi     
.sp     


Note that the full class name is specified, including all packages and subpackages separated by a slash (\f3/\fR)\&. For easier cut and paste operations, it is also possible to use the method name format produced by the \f3-XX:+PrintCompilation\fR and \f3-XX:+LogCompilation\fR options:
.sp     
.nf     
\f3\-XX:CompileCommand=exclude,java\&.lang\&.String::indexOf\fP
.fi     
.nf     
\f3\fP
.fi     
.sp     


If the method is specified without the signature, the command will be applied to all methods with the specified name\&. However, you can also specify the signature of the method in the class file format\&. In this case, you should enclose the arguments in quotation marks, because otherwise the shell treats the semicolon as command end\&. For example, if you want to exclude only the \f3indexOf(String)\fR method of the \f3String\fR class from being compiled, use the following:
.sp     
.nf     
\f3\-XX:CompileCommand="exclude,java/lang/String\&.indexOf,(Ljava/lang/String;)I"\fP
.fi     
.nf     
\f3\fP
.fi     
.sp     


You can also use the asterisk (*) as a wildcard for class and method names\&. For example, to exclude all \f3indexOf()\fR methods in all classes from being compiled, use the following:
.sp     
.nf     
\f3\-XX:CompileCommand=exclude,*\&.indexOf\fP
.fi     
.nf     
\f3\fP
.fi     
.sp     


The commas and periods are aliases for spaces, making it easier to pass compiler commands through a shell\&. You can pass arguments to \f3-XX:CompileCommand\fR using spaces as separators by enclosing the argument in quotation marks:
.sp     
.nf     
\f3\-XX:CompileCommand="exclude java/lang/String indexOf"\fP
.fi     
.nf     
\f3\fP
.fi     
.sp     


Note that after parsing the commands passed on the command line using the \f3-XX:CompileCommand\fR options, the JIT compiler then reads commands from the \f3\&.hotspot_compiler\fR file\&. You can add commands to this file or specify a different file using the \f3-XX:CompileCommandFile\fR option\&.

To add several commands, either specify the \f3-XX:CompileCommand\fR option multiple times, or separate each argument with the newline separator (\f3\en\fR)\&. The following commands are available:
.RS     
.TP     
break
Set a breakpoint when debugging the JVM to stop at the beginning of compilation of the specified method\&.
.TP

Exclude compilation logging (with the \f3-XX:+LogCompilation\fR option) for all methods except for the specified method\&. By default, logging is performed for all compiled methods\&.
.TP     
option
This command can be used to pass a JIT compilation option to the specified method in place of the last argument (\fIoption\fR)\&. The compilation option is set at the end, after the method name\&. For example, to enable the \f3BlockLayoutByFrequency\fR option for the \f3append()\fR method of the \f3StringBuffer\fR class, use the following:
.sp     
.nf     
\f3\-XX:CompileCommand=option,java/lang/StringBuffer\&.append,BlockLayoutByFrequency\fP
.fi     
.nf

.fi     
.sp     


You can specify multiple compilation options, separated by commas or spaces\&.
.TP     
print
Print generated assembler code after compilation of the specified method\&.
.TP     
quiet
Do not print the compile commands\&. By default, the commands that you specify with the -\f3XX:CompileCommand\fR option are printed; for example, if you exclude from compilation the \f3indexOf()\fR method of the \f3String\fR class, then the following will be printed to standard output:
.sp

\f3CompilerOracle: exclude java/lang/String\&.indexOf\fP
.fi     
.nf

.sp     
.nf     
\f3\-XX:MaxHeapFreeRatio=75\fP
.fi     
.nf     
\f3\fP
.fi     
.sp     

.TP
-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=\fIsize\fR
.br
Sets the maximum amount of native memory that can be allocated for class metadata\&. By default, the size is not limited\&. The amount of metadata for an application depends on the application itself, other running applications, and the amount of memory available on the system\&.

The following example shows how to set the maximum class metadata size to 256 MB:
.sp     
.nf     
\f3\-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=256m\fP
.fi     
.nf     
\f3\fP
.fi     
.sp     

.TP
-XX:MaxNewSize=\fIsize\fR
.br
Sets the maximum size (in bytes) of the heap for the young generation (nursery)\&. The default value is set ergonomically\&.
.TP
-XX:MaxTenuringThreshold=\fIthreshold\fR
.br
Sets the maximum tenuring threshold for use in adaptive GC sizing\&. The largest value is 15\&. The default value is 15 for the parallel (throughput) collector, and 6 for the CMS collector\&.

The following example shows how to set the maximum tenuring threshold to 10:
.sp     
.nf     
\f3\-XX:MaxTenuringThreshold=10\fP
.fi     
.nf     
\f3\fP
.fi     
.sp     

.TP
-XX:MetaspaceSize=\fIsize\fR
.br
Sets the size of the allocated class metadata space that will trigger a garbage collection the first time it is exceeded\&. This threshold for a garbage collection is increased or decreased depending on the amount of metadata used\&. The default size depends on the platform\&.
.TP
-XX:MinHeapFreeRatio=\fIpercent\fR
.br
Sets the minimum allowed percentage of free heap space (0 to 100) after a GC event\&. If free heap space falls below this value, then the heap will be expanded\&. By default, this value is set to 40%\&.

The following example shows how to set the minimum free heap ratio to 25%:
.sp     
.nf     
\f3\-XX:MinHeapFreeRatio=25\fP
.fi     
.nf     
\f3\fP
.fi     
.sp     

.TP
-XX:NewRatio=\fIratio\fR
.br
Sets the ratio between young and old generation sizes\&. By default, this option is set to 2\&. The following example shows how to set the young/old ratio to 1:
.sp     
.nf     
\f3\-XX:NewRatio=1\fP
.fi     
.nf     
\f3\fP
.fi     
.sp     

.TP
-XX:NewSize=\fIsize\fR
.br
Sets the initial size (in bytes) of the heap for the young generation (nursery)\&. Append the letter \f3k\fR or \f3K\fR to indicate kilobytes, \f3m\fR or \f3M\fR to indicate megabytes, \f3g\fR or \f3G\fR to indicate gigabytes\&.

The young generation region of the heap is used for new objects\&. GC is performed in this region more often than in other regions\&. If the size for the young generation is too low, then a large number of minor GCs will be performed\&. If the size is too high, then only full GCs will be performed, which can take a long time to complete\&. Oracle recommends that you keep the size for the young generation between a half and a quarter of the overall heap size\&.

The following examples show how to set the initial size of young generation to 256 MB using various units:
.sp     
.nf     
\f3\-XX:NewSize=256m\fP
.fi     
.nf     
\f3\-XX:NewSize=262144k\fP

\f3\-XX:NewSize=268435456\fP
.fi     
.nf     
\f3\fP
.fi     
.sp     


The \f3-XX:NewSize\fR option is equivalent to \f3-Xmn\fR\&.
.TP
-XX:ParallelGCThreads=\fIthreads\fR
.br
Sets the number of threads used for parallel garbage collection in the young and old generations\&. The default value depends on the number of CPUs available to the JVM\&.

For example, to set the number of threads for parallel GC to 2, specify the following option:
.sp     
.nf     
\f3\-XX:ParallelGCThreads=2\fP
.fi     
.nf     
\f3\fP
.fi     
.sp     

.TP
-XX:+ParallelRefProcEnabled
.br
Enables parallel reference processing\&. By default, this option is disabled\&.
.TP
-XX:+PrintAdaptiveSizePolicy
.br
Enables printing of information about adaptive generation sizing\&. By default, this option is disabled\&.
.TP
-XX:+PrintGC
.br
Enables printing of messages at every GC\&. By default, this option is disabled\&.
.TP
-XX:+PrintGCApplicationConcurrentTime
.br
Enables printing of how much time elapsed since the last pause (for example, a GC pause)\&. By default, this option is disabled\&.
.TP
-XX:+PrintGCApplicationStoppedTime
.br
Enables printing of how much time the pause (for example, a GC pause) lasted\&. By default, this option is disabled\&.
.TP
-XX+PrintGCDateStamp
.br
Enables printing of a date stamp at every GC\&. By default, this option is disabled\&.
.TP
-XX:+PrintGCDetails
.br
Enables printing of detailed messages at every GC\&. By default, this option is disabled\&.
.TP
-XX:+PrintGCTaskTimeStamps
.br
Enables printing of time stamps for every individual GC worker thread task\&. By default, this option is disabled\&.
.TP
-XX:+PrintGCTimeStamp
.br
Enables printing of time stamps at every GC\&. By default, this option is disabled\&.
.TP
-XX:+PrintTenuringDistribution
.br
Enables printing of tenuring age information\&. The following is an example of the output:
.sp     
.nf     
\f3Desired survivor size 48286924 bytes, new threshold 10 (max 10)\fP
.fi     
.nf

.fi     
.sp     


Age 1 objects are the youngest survivors (they were created after the previous scavenge, survived the latest scavenge, and moved from eden to survivor space)\&. Age 2 objects have survived two scavenges (during the second scavenge they were copied from one survivor space to the next)\&. And so on\&.

In the preceding example, 28 992 024 bytes survived one scavenge and were copied from eden to survivor space, 1 366 864 bytes are occupied by age 2 objects, etc\&. The third value in each row is the cumulative size of objects of age n or less\&.

By default, this option is disabled\&.
.TP
-XX:+ScavengeBeforeFullGC
.br
Enables GC of the young generation before each full GC\&. This option is enabled by default\&. Oracle recommends that you \fIdo not\fR disable it, because scavenging the young generation before a full GC can reduce the number of objects reachable from the old generation space into the young generation space\&. To disable GC of the young generation before each full GC, specify \f3-XX:-ScavengeBeforeFullGC\fR\&.
.TP
-XX:SoftRefLRUPolicyMSPerMB=\fItime\fR
.br
Sets the amount of time (in milliseconds) a softly reachable object is kept active on the heap after the last time it was referenced\&. The default value is one second of lifetime per free megabyte in the heap\&. The \f3-XX:SoftRefLRUPolicyMSPerMB\fR option accepts integer values representing milliseconds per one megabyte of the current heap size (for Java HotSpot Client VM) or the maximum possible heap size (for Java HotSpot Server VM)\&. This difference means that the Client VM tends to flush soft references rather than grow the heap, whereas the Server VM tends to grow the heap rather than flush soft references\&. In the latter case, the value of the \f3-Xmx\fR option has a significant effect on how quickly soft references are garbage collected\&.

The following example shows how to set the value to 2\&.5 seconds:
.sp     
.nf     
\f3\-XX:SoftRefLRUPolicyMSPerMB=2500\fP
.fi     
.nf     
\f3\fP
.fi     
.sp     

.TP
-XX:SurvivorRatio=\fIratio\fR
.br
Sets the ratio between eden space size and survivor space size\&. By default, this option is set to 8\&. The following example shows how to set the eden/survivor space ratio to 4:
.sp     
.nf     
\f3\-XX:SurvivorRatio=4\fP
.fi     
.nf     
\f3\fP
.fi     
.sp     

.TP
-XX:TargetSurvivorRatio=\fIpercent\fR
.br
Sets the desired percentage of survivor space (0 to 100) used after young garbage collection\&. By default, this option is set to 50%\&.

The following example shows how to set the target survivor space ratio to 30%:
.sp     
.nf     
\f3\-XX:TargetSurvivorRatio=30\fP
.fi     
.nf     
\f3\fP
.fi     
.sp     

.TP
-XX:TLABSize=\fIsize\fR
.br
Sets the initial size (in bytes) of a thread-local allocation buffer (TLAB)\&. Append the letter \f3k\fR or \f3K\fR to indicate kilobytes, \f3m\fR or \f3M\fR to indicate megabytes, \f3g\fR or \f3G\fR to indicate gigabytes\&. If this option is set to 0, then the JVM chooses the initial size automatically\&.

The following example shows how to set the initial TLAB size to 512 KB:
.sp     
.nf     
\f3\-XX:TLABSize=512k\fP
.fi     
.nf     
\f3\fP
.fi     
.sp     

.TP
-XX:+UseAdaptiveSizePolicy
.br
Enables the use of adaptive generation sizing\&. This option is enabled by default\&. To disable adaptive generation sizing, specify \f3-XX:-UseAdaptiveSizePolicy\fR and set the size of the memory allocation pool explicitly (see the \f3-XX:SurvivorRatio\fR option)\&.
.TP
-XX:+UseCMSInitiatingOccupancyOnly
.br
Enables the use of the occupancy value as the only criterion for initiating the CMS collector\&. By default, this option is disabled and other criteria may be used\&.
.TP
-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC
.br
Enables the use of the CMS garbage collector for the old generation\&. Oracle recommends that you use the CMS garbage collector when application latency requirements cannot be met by the throughput (\f3-XX:+UseParallelGC\fR) garbage collector\&. The G1 garbage collector (\f3-XX:+UseG1GC\fR) is another alternative\&.

By default, this option is disabled and the collector is chosen automatically based on the configuration of the machine and type of the JVM\&. When this option is enabled, the \f3-XX:+UseParNewGC\fR option is automatically set and you should not disable it, because the following combination of options has been deprecated in JDK 8: \f3-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:-UseParNewGC\fR\&.
.TP
-XX:+UseG1GC
.br
Enables the use of the G1 garbage collector\&. It is a server-style garbage collector, targeted for multiprocessor machines with a large amount of RAM\&. It meets GC pause time goals with high probability, while maintaining good throughput\&. The G1 collector is recommended for applications requiring large heaps (sizes of around 6 GB or larger) with limited GC latency requirements (stable and predictable pause time below 0\&.5 seconds)\&.

By default, this option is disabled and the collector is chosen automatically based on the configuration of the machine and type of the JVM\&.
.TP
-XX:+UseGCOverheadLimit
.br
Enables the use of a policy that limits the proportion of time spent by the JVM on GC before an \f3OutOfMemoryError\fR exception is thrown\&. This option is enabled, by default and the parallel GC will throw an \f3OutOfMemoryError\fR if more than 98% of the total time is spent on garbage collection and less than 2% of the heap is recovered\&. When the heap is small, this feature can be used to prevent applications from running for long periods of time with little or no progress\&. To disable this option, specify \f3-XX:-UseGCOverheadLimit\fR\&.
.TP
-XX:+UseNUMA
.br
Enables performance optimization of an application on a machine with nonuniform memory architecture (NUMA) by increasing the application\&'s use of lower latency memory\&. By default, this option is disabled and no optimization for NUMA is made\&. The option is only available when the parallel garbage collector is used (\f3-XX:+UseParallelGC\fR)\&.
.TP
-XX:+UseParallelGC
.br
Enables the use of the parallel scavenge garbage collector (also known as the throughput collector) to improve the performance of your application by leveraging multiple processors\&.

By default, this option is disabled and the collector is chosen automatically based on the configuration of the machine and type of the JVM\&. If it is enabled, then the \f3-XX:+UseParallelOldGC\fR option is automatically enabled, unless you explicitly disable it\&.
.TP
-XX:+UseParallelOldGC
.br
Enables the use of the parallel garbage collector for full GCs\&. By default, this option is disabled\&. Enabling it automatically enables the \f3-XX:+UseParallelGC\fR option\&.
.TP
-XX:+UseParNewGC
.br
Enables the use of parallel threads for collection in the young generation\&. By default, this option is disabled\&. It is automatically enabled when you set the \f3-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC\fR option\&. Using the \f3-XX:+UseParNewGC\fR option without the \f3-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC\fR option was deprecated in JDK 8\&.
.TP
-XX:+UseSerialGC
.br
Enables the use of the serial garbage collector\&. This is generally the best choice for small and simple applications that do not require any special functionality from garbage collection\&. By default, this option is disabled and the collector is chosen automatically based on the configuration of the machine and type of the JVM\&.
.TP
-XX:+UseTLAB
.br
Enables the use of thread-local allocation blocks (TLABs) in the young generation space\&. This option is enabled by default\&. To disable the use of TLABs, specify \f3-XX:-UseTLAB\fR\&.
.SS DEPRECATED\ AND\ REMOVED\ OPTIONS

.br
Sets the percentage of time (0 to 100) by which the incremental mode duty cycle is shifted to the right within the period between minor collections\&. This option was deprecated in JDK 8 with no replacement, following the deprecation of the \f3-XX:+CMSIncrementalMode\fR option\&.
.TP
-XX:+CMSIncrementalPacing
.br
Enables automatic adjustment of the incremental mode duty cycle based on statistics collected while the JVM is running\&. This option was deprecated in JDK 8 with no replacement, following the deprecation of the \f3-XX:+CMSIncrementalMode\fR option\&.
.TP
-XX:CMSIncrementalSafetyFactor=\fIpercent\fR
.br
Sets the percentage of time (0 to 100) used to add conservatism when computing the duty cycle\&. This option was deprecated in JDK 8 with no replacement, following the deprecation of the \f3-XX:+CMSIncrementalMode\fR option\&.
.TP

Sets the maximum permanent generation space size (in bytes)\&. This option was deprecated in JDK 8, and superseded by the \f3-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize\fR option\&.
.TP
-XX:PermSize=\fIsize\fR
.br
Sets the space (in bytes) allocated to the permanent generation that triggers a garbage collection if it is exceeded\&. This option was deprecated un JDK 8, and superseded by the \f3-XX:MetaspaceSize\fR option\&.
.TP
-XX:+UseSplitVerifier
.br
Enables splitting of the verification process\&. By default, this option was enabled in the previous releases, and verification was split into two phases: type referencing (performed by the compiler) and type checking (performed by the JVM runtime)\&. This option was deprecated in JDK 8, and verification is now split by default without a way to disable it\&.
.TP
