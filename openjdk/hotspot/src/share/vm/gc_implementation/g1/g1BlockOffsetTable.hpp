// The CollectedHeap type requires subtypes to implement a method
// "block_start".  For some subtypes, notably generational
// systems using card-table-based write barriers, the efficiency of this
// operation may be important.  Implementations of the "BlockOffsetArray"
// class may be useful in providing such efficient implementations.
//
// While generally mirroring the structure of the BOT for GenCollectedHeap,
// the following types are tailored more towards G1's uses; these should,
// however, be merged back into a common BOT to avoid code duplication
// and reduce maintenance overhead.

//
// A main impediment to the consolidation of this code might be the
// effect of making some of the block_start*() calls non-const as
// below. Whether that might adversely affect performance optimizations
// that compilers might normally perform in the case of non-G1
// collectors needs to be carefully investigated prior to any such
// consolidation.
